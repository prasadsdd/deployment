1. Getting started with CI-CD process:
      * Setup the dockerfile and .dockerignore file
      * Setup the .github\workflows dir and aws.yaml file within


      * Go to AWS console and create a new IAM user

IAM User = user >> create user >> go to policy >>( AmazonBedrockFullAccess, AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess , AmazonEC2FullAccess ) give access to this policys.
user name >> Security Credentials >> create access key >> command Line Interface (CLI) >> i under >> next >> create access key >> download.csv >> done .
 


      * Now create one ECR repo to store/save docker image:
        AWS console >> Go to ECR >> Region: us-east-1 >> Hit create repository >>
        repo name: vehicleproj >> hit create repository >> copy and keep uri


      * Now create EC2 Ubuntu server >> AWS console >> EC2 >> Launch Instance >> name: vehicledata-machine
        >> Image: Ubuntu >> AMI: Ubuntu Server 24.04 (free tier) >> Instance: T2 Medium (~chargeable-3.5rs/hr)
        >> create new key pair (name: proj1key) >> allow for https and http traffic >> storage: 30gb >> Launch
        >> Go to instance >> click on "Connect" >> Connect using EC2 Instance Connect 
        >> Connect (Terminal will be launched) 



2. Open EC2 and Install docker in EC2 Machine:
      ## Optinal
      sudo apt-get update -y
      sudo apt-get upgrade
      ## Required (Because Docker is'nt there in our EC2 server - [docker --version])
      curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
      sudo sh get-docker.sh
      sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
      newgrp docker

3. Next step is to connect Github with EC2(Self hosted runner):
      * select your project on Github >> go to settings >> Actions >> Runner >> New self hosted runner
        >> Select OS (Linux) >> Now step by step run all "Download" related commands on EC2 server 

        >> run first "Configure" command (hit enter instead of setting a runner group, runner name: self-hosted)
        >> enter any additional label (hit enter to skip) >> name of work folder (again hit enter)

        >> Now run second "Configure" command (./run.sh) and runner will get connected to Github
        >> To crosscheck, go back to Github and click on Runner and you will see runner state as "idle"
        >> If you do ctrl+c on EC2 server then runner will shut then restart with "./run.sh"


4. Setup your Github secrets: (Github project>Settings>Secretand Variable>Actions>NewRepoSecret)
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
      ECR_REPO

5. CI-CD pipeline will be triggered at next commit and push.


6. Now we need to activate the 5000 port of our EC2 instance:
      * Go to the instance > Security > Go to Security Groups > Edit inbound rules > add rule
        > type: Custom TCP > Port range: 5000 > 0.0.0.0/0 > Save rules
7. Now paste the public ip address on the address bar +:5080 and your app will be launched.
